			<p> The long awaited moment is right around the corner! We will be releasing one never heard before song within the next few weeks in anticipation for the long awaiting debut album, Destruction of Humanity. </br> Tom has been working tirelessly over the last few months to really kick things into motion and with all instruments completed, it's down to Gaz to get into that booth and finish off his last few songs. Then into the final stages we go! Exciting times! We genuinly can't wait for you guys to hear it and hear all your comments. </br>
			The entire album has been engineered by Tom from start to finish, so a massive shout out to him! If you haven't heard, he has his own start-up business in recording so head over to <a href="#">Shattered Glass Studio</a> for information! </br> </br>
			Speaking about start-up's, Gaz has also started is own design business, for your logo and album cover needs. He does other design requirements as well so make your way to <a href="#">Sinister Arts</a> and find out more! </br> </br>
			Steve has taken up website building and is learning HTML and CSS in whatever time he get, in fact...he built this very site as his first project! And you will see the site updating regularly as he learns.
