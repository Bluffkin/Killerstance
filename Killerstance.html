“They have a bone crunching sound that’s rhythmic, heavy and dripping with melodic twists and technical turns never letting you forget that this is metal”. ---Total Rock Radio <br>

<em>Biography</em>
        
<br>
<br>
Hertfordshire based British Metal band with a little bit extra, drawing influences from a much wider scope than you might expect. Killerstance have been performing together for almost 4 years and their name in the music industry is steadily growing.
<br>
Killerstance have had some great events under their belts from performing at small local venues, their occasional London stints (i.e. Camden Rock & The Underworld) to unsigned festivals based in Hertfordshire (Westmill Farm Festival 2009-10 & Hertford Music Mystery Tour 2012)<br>
        <br>
<em>Description</em> <br>
        <br>
Their music is energetic, creative and powerful leaving room for amazing harmonies and immense changes in rhythm. 
Although they have recently spent a lot of time in the studio, Killerstance have always been known to make one hell of a comeback, steal the show and attract swelling crowds.
