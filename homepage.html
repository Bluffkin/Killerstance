        &quot;They have a bone crunching sound that&apos;s rhythmic, heavy and dripping with melodic twists </br> and technical turns never letting you forget that this is metal&quot;. --- Total Rock Radio </p>

        <p class="maintext"> Hertfordshire based British metal band with a little bit extra, drawing influences from a much wider scope than you might expect. </br>
        Killerstance have been performing together for almost 4 years and their name in the music industry is steadily growing. 
        </br>
        Killerstance have had some great events under their belts from performing at small local venues, their occasional London stints (i.e. Camden Rock & The Underworld) to unsigned festivals based in Hertfordshire (Westmill Farm Festival 2009-10 & Hertford Music Mystery Tour 2012) </p>
